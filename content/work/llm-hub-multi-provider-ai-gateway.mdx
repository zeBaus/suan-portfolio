## Problem

As AI features expanded, relying on a single provider created issues:
- inconsistent latency during peak times,
- vendor-specific API differences,
- limited control over retries/failover,
- difficulty observing cost and performance trends.

We needed a single place to manage **routing, retries, and provider choice** without rewriting application logic.

## Approach

- Built **LLM Hub** as an asynchronous gateway with a **unified request/response contract**.
- Implemented **provider adapters** to abstract away vendor differences.
- Added routing strategies (example patterns):
  - default provider + fallback provider
  - model-based routing by capability
  - timeout-based failover
- Designed the flow for async execution where appropriate (queue / background jobs), so the app could:
  - return quickly for long-running tasks,
  - poll or receive callbacks when complete.
- Captured consistent metadata for observability:
  - provider used,
  - latency,
  - failure reason,
  - retry counts (useful for tuning).

## Result

- Improved resilience through controlled failover and provider abstraction.
- Reduced integration complexity for application teams (one interface instead of many).
- Enabled clearer visibility into performance/cost tradeoffs across providers.

## What I’d Improve Next

- Add policy-based routing (per customer/feature SLAs).
- Add caching for repeat prompts where safe.
- Add cost ceilings / circuit breakers per provider to control spend.
