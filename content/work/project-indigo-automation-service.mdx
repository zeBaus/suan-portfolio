## Problem

Manual or ad-hoc automation was slowing down operations and causing inconsistency.
We needed a dependable service to run workflows with:
- predictable execution,
- clear status and audit trails,
- safe retries and failure handling.

## Approach

- Implemented a service-oriented workflow model:
  - explicit job states,
  - clear inputs/outputs,
  - failure categories for triage.
- Prioritized operational safety:
  - timeouts and guards for long-running jobs,
  - retry strategy for transient failures,
  - structured logging for diagnostics.
- Kept integration points clean via an API boundary so other apps/tools could trigger automation without tight coupling.

## Result

- More consistent workflow execution (less manual work, fewer “it depends” runs).
- Faster triage through clear status and failure signals.
- Better foundation for scaling automation as requirements grew.

## What I’d Improve Next

- Add dashboards for per-workflow success rate and average runtime.
- Introduce queue-based execution for smoother load handling at scale.
