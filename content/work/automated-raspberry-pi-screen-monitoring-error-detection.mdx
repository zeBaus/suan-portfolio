title: "Automated Raspberry Pi Screen Monitoring & Error Detection"
summary: "Built a Python-based monitoring system that periodically pulls Raspberry Pi screenshots from AWS S3, compares them against expected visuals, and logs anomalies to catch device/UI issues early."

## Problem

Raspberry Pi deployments can fail in subtle ways (blank screens, incorrect UI state, app crashes, unexpected overlays).
We needed a lightweight way to **detect issues remotely** without waiting for customer reports.

## Approach

- Built a **scheduled Python monitoring workflow** (every ~30–60 minutes).
- Pulled the **latest screenshots from AWS S3** for each device.
- Compared the current screenshot against **expected visual states** to flag anomalies.
- Used **OCR where needed** to validate on-screen text and error banners.
- Logged anomalies in a structured way so the team could triage quickly and spot patterns over time.

## Result

- Faster detection of “silent failures” (device or UI issues that looked “online” but weren’t usable).
- Reduced manual checking time and improved responsiveness for support/ops.
- Created a repeatable pattern for monitoring other visual workflows.

## Notes

This project reinforced a practical monitoring mindset:
**small, reliable signals → fast triage → fewer surprises in production.**
