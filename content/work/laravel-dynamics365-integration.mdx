## Problem

The business needed a stable way to push/pull records between an internal Laravel app and Microsoft Dynamics 365.
Key issues were:
- different data shapes and validation rules,
- authentication/token handling,
- rate limits and transient failures,
- ensuring updates didn’t create duplicates or inconsistent states.

## Approach

- Built an integration layer in Laravel with clear boundaries:
  - data mapping (internal → D365 and back),
  - auth/session handling,
  - retries/backoff for transient failures,
  - structured error logging for support.
- Normalized payloads through a mapping layer to keep application code clean.
- Designed safer sync behavior using:
  - idempotent operations where possible,
  - deterministic matching keys to prevent duplicates,
  - explicit failure handling and retry strategy.

## Result

- Reliable sync between systems with fewer manual corrections.
- Cleaner code separation: app features stayed focused while integration logic remained isolated.
- Better operational visibility when failures occurred (clear logs + failure categorization).

## Notes

This project is a good example of “outcome-first” engineering:
the goal wasn’t just connectivity—it was **consistency, debuggability, and predictable operations**.
