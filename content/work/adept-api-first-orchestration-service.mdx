## Problem

We needed a reliable way to run **multi-stage, asynchronous jobs** with clear inputs/outputs and stable state handling.
The existing approach made it hard to scale and harder to keep the pipeline modular as requirements grew. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Approach

- Built **Adept** as an **API-first orchestration service** to centralize job control and state.
- Designed a **multi-stage workflow model** (job states + transitions) so each stage could be retried and observed independently.
- Structured data contracts for **validated inputs** and **structured outputs** to reduce downstream ambiguity.
- Kept a **single source of truth for job states**, making the system easier to monitor and debug.
- Decoupled **heavy AI extraction** from **real-time conversational refinement**, improving responsiveness and reducing coupling.

## Result

- Improved scalability by separating CPU-heavy AI stages from time-sensitive interactions.
- Made workflows easier to extend with new stages without breaking existing jobs.
- Clearer operational visibility through explicit state transitions and structured outputs.

## What I’d Improve Next

- Add richer observability (stage timings, failure categorization, alerting thresholds).
- Introduce idempotency keys and stronger replay controls for safer retries at scale.
