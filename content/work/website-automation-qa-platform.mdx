## Problem

Quality checks were inconsistent across projects:
- teams ran tests differently (or not at all),
- failures were hard to reproduce,
- results weren’t standardized for non-technical stakeholders,
- regression coverage drifted over time.

We needed a practical platform that made automation **repeatable, visible, and easy to run**.

## Approach

- Designed a lightweight platform concept around:
  - **standardized test execution** (consistent entry points and configs),
  - **repeatable environments** (container-friendly where possible),
  - **reporting artifacts** (screenshots/logs, run summaries).
- Implemented automation flows (initially Selenium for safety/familiarity, then modernized toward Playwright where it provided better stability and DX).
- Focused on high-signal checks:
  - smoke flows,
  - critical user journeys,
  - “must not break” pages and forms.
- Added a predictable way to triage failures:
  - capture evidence,
  - label flaky tests,
  - separate infra failures from product regressions.

## Result

- Standardized how QA automation runs across projects.
- Faster reproduction and triage due to consistent artifacts and reporting.
- A foundation that can evolve with tooling while keeping outcomes stable.

## Takeaway

This platform reflects my usual approach:
**ship a reliable baseline quickly**, then **iterate toward more modern tooling and better developer experience** without losing delivery momentum.
